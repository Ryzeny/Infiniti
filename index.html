        <h1 class="climatetext reveal">Climate Change</h1>
        <h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">Climate change is the long-term, continued shifting of temperatures and weather patterns on planet Earth; an evolution driven by human activities. <br><br>
            In the over 4.5 billion years that Earth has existed, orbiting the sun in the small stellar neighborhood we call home, our planet has gone through many changes. But humans have had a profound impact.<br><br>
            Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) produces "greenhouse gasses" like carbon dioxide. These gases, which are produced in industries including agriculture, energy and more, have earned this name because once in Earth's atmosphere, they trap heat against our planet, preventing it from escaping and creating a warming "greenhouse effect."
            </h2>

            <br>

        <h1 class="climatetext reveal">Impact Of Climate Change</h1>
        <h2 class="climatetext2 reveal" >Impact of Climate Change is visible across the globe<br><br>
            <h2 class="climatetext2 blue reveal">The Global Temperature is Rising</h2> 
            <h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">Scientists from NASA and other research institutions around the world have been routinely collecting temperature data from a wide number of locations all over the planet. Their records of Earth’s average temperature go back to the 1880s, the earliest year for which reliable instrumental records were available worldwide. The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has maintained global average monthly and annual records of combined land and ocean surface temperatures for more than 130 years.
            These data show that temperatures have climbed to more than 1.8°F (1°C) above pre-industrial levels as of 2015, and the long-term global upward trend is clear and unambiguous
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="climatetext2 blue reveal">Warming Oceans</h2>
            <h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">In 2020, global ocean warming temperature was 0.76 degrees Celsius higher than the average temperature for the past one hundred years.
	        While the annual divergence fluctuates, with some years hotter and others cooler, there is a definite upward trend, visible in the data.
	        Continuing global warming is set to increase the strength, frequency, spatial extent and duration of extreme weather events.
            Annual average temperatures of the oceans’ surfaces have been diverging from the 20th century (1900-1999) average more and more since the 1980s. In 2020, global ocean surface temperatures were 0.76 degrees Celsius higher than that century’s average<br><br>

            <h2 class="climatetext2 blue reveal">Shrinking Ice Sheets</h2>
            <h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">Ice sheets contain vast amounts of frozen freshwater and cover such a large surface area that they influence global weather patterns. NASA satellites have been tracking shrinking ice sheets for decades, documenting significant losses since 2002. The Greenland ice sheet – the biggest in the world – has been of particular concern to scientists after documenting a 30 percent decline in total mass between 1979 to 2006. 2019 saw record melting, with the sheet losing a whopping 197 gigatonnes. <br><br>
                
            <h2 class="climatetext2 blue reveal">Glacial Retreat</h2><h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">
            Climate change-induced glacier retreat can have substantial localized impacts that often go unnoticed in the sparsely populated regions where they occur. Here we predict that retreat of Grand Plateau Glacier, in southern Alaska, USA, will reroute the outlet of a major river with consequences for human activity in this remote region. The glacier terminus separates Alsek Lake and the present Alsek River outlet from Grand Plateau Lake. In response to thinning and retreat of that terminus, both lakes have more than doubled in size since 1958.<BR><BR>

            <h2 class="climatetext2 blue reveal">Decreased Snow Cover</h2><h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">
            As snow cover declines, dark soils and vegetation absorb more of the Sun’s energy. The Geophysical Research Letters study pointed out that declining snow cover raises ground temperatures and increases the thickness of the active layer—the uppermost layer of permafrost that thaws each summer. When organic material in thawing permafrost decomposes, it can release methane, a potent greenhouse gas when released to the atmosphere.<br><br>

            <h2 class="climatetext2 blue reveal">Sea Level Rise</h2><h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">
            As humans continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, oceans have tempered the effect. The world's seas have absorbed more than 90 percent of the heat from these gases, but it’s taking a toll on our oceans: 2021 set a new record for ocean heating.
            Rising seas is one of those climate change effects. Average sea levels have swelled over 8 inches (about 23 cm) since 1880, with about three of those inches gained in the last 25 years. Every year, the sea rises another .13 inches (3.2 mm.) New research published on February 15, 2022 shows that sea level rise is accelerating and projected to rise by a foot by 2050.<br><BR>
            
            <h2 class="climatetext2 blue reveal">Ocean Acidification</h2><h2 class="climatetext2 reveal">
            Ocean acidification has been shown to affect organisms and ecosystems, impacting ecosystem services such as food security, by endangering fisheries and aquaculture. It also impacts coastal protection (for example by weakening coral reefs shielding the coastline), transportation and tourism. The ocean’s capacity to store carbon dioxide and help regulate the climate will be affected, as the capacity of the ocean to absorb CO2 decreases as ocean acidification increases. Regular observations and measurements of ocean acidification in open oceans and coastal areas are necessary to improve our understanding of the effects, enable modelling and predictions and help inform mitigation and adaptation strategies.<br><br>
